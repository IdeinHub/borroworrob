Idein

meta-currency of open ideas and knowledge

Serial Number: 021320141858

Nowadays money isn't made out of any precious materials nor is it related to the amount of gold or whatever else owned by the country which produced it. The evidence that money is not tied to any commodity makes it totally fictional without any inherent value. In fact, current monetary systems operate on a reciprocal set of beliefs: as long as enough people believe in the value of money the system works. Such systems highlight the fictional nature of money. Money becomes the currency of a localized storytelling process influenced by fictional structures that can be contributed by everyone.

With our intervention at BorroworroB we thought to present seminal references and tools to acknowledge how this belief mechanism can connect what people value to the value of money. 
We consider how social consciousness is reflected into personal essential aims of life and authentic needs which emerge naturally in every person_(A), one experience after another. 
That's why thinking about any potential currency the following essential question has to be asked: what is the value?

In the media and at political level, the answer to this question remains largely organized around information coming from central banks and governments. We believe this contributes to creating a feeling of disconnection and artificial inequality between what people value, and what is recognized as valuable currency.

Connectivity is bringing together the planetary organism in ways that everyone experience at localized speed. Because of increased connectivity between people at different levels (communication technologies and the internet, low-cost flights…) we can go beyond previous Reality Models_(B) organized largely around the notion of lack and scarcity of resources. This was our best option to make sense of reality, in a world where the average individual life-span was shorter and the distances to cover in time and space to experience communication with someone else were larger.

Current technology developments make it possible to connect people and communities in a way that was never possible before. We believe we can use these resources to organize the information about what is valuable for individuals and society in a way that provide better correlation to what feels honest and creates the conditions for a better quality of life. In other words, we want to help reconnect what is actually useful to the value of currency. This obviously changes from one day to the next, from one place to another. It is therefore necessary to create the conditions into which currency becomes a dynamic structure influenced by the information available from the context where it is traded. 
Information that when used can affect the state of a dynamic system, go beyond understanding value as something material or quantifiable. There is no inherent value in duplicating it, owning it, or in having worked hard at it. There is only value in using it. Current economics are obviously no longer in tune with this way of perceiving the value_(C).

We will extend background references and strategies for implementation with all interested people, but we think it is paramount that this project exist as open-source, with or without us. Please feel free to share whatever thought, image or sound you have produced while reading these lines.

As a proposed platform for initial exchange we have created an account at: https://github.com/IdeinHub

Proposed features of meta-currency counted in Ideins_(D):

1. Idein emphasizes not what happens before, but what happens after the idea is generated or distributed. It doesn't reflect ownership or past work, but stimulates future creative outputs. Creators of ideas have no inherent right to be compensated for what they did just because they did it. The amount of trouble it took to arrive at it, resources that went into producing it earlier or just simply possessing the idea is not profitable either. Idein is proactive. It freely supports a desirable and viable future instead of reactive representation of past acts_(E).

2. Singular ideas are free. Idein doesn't attain value to the idea before being creatively implemented. There is no need to ration it, charge for it or own it before being used.

3. Ideas are infinitely replicable by chain reaction branching. The idea can rise its value counted in Ideins when being part of a multi- leveled, self-amplified chain of interconnected ideas.

4. Ideas as being immaterial are collected online and accessible to everyone. Such virtual bank stores ideas, tracks number of its branches and practical applications with a special focus on the strength of its creative impact. That's why the value of the idea counted in Ideins is higher when used and reproduced more times, more accurately and meaningfully.

5. Idein embodies plurality, diversity, self organization and collaboration instead of radiating concepts of greed, lack, debt, materiality, normative and majoritarian standards. Idein emphasizes the strength of a potential and aims to help people to govern their lives by their creations in order to regain control over one's own sense of responsibility.

. (D) From Ancient Greek *1- witty or creative idea, *2- to know or to see, in a creative manner

. (E) If we take as reference the idea that all events, past, present and future, coexist in four dimensional space-time. Idein shifts understanding of currency to the context of future which relates to 'use of space' topic of Currency as Space.
   

Rule for Use
100 words how the currency is to be used, what kind of space, and the spatial/geographical limits of its use.

After registering and signing up to Idein Bank each user has a full right to upload unlimited amount of ideas. Nevertheless it doesn't create any profit. Ideas gain value measured in Idein currency while being debugged and developed or while being implemented in the following:
1.	more branching = shared profit for idea creator and all previous idea developers 
2.	more debugging = more profit for the singular debugger 
3.	more often idea realization = more shared profit for idea creator, developers, debuggers and  implementor. The idea creator and implementor gets the biggest share. Share of the  implementor additionally depends on the creative impact of the realization. 
Moreover Idein Bank tracks open source ideas evolution which can be treated as an extension of creative communication and new way of thoughts organization based on multiplying by sharing. Idein Bank helps also to experience idea development process in more conscious way. Idein Bank visualizes variety of unused possibilities appearing from idea implementation to its realization minimizing amount of creative waste by its recycling and upcycling.
 

Directions for exposition
Idein is a concept of meta-currency of open ideas and knowledge in its early stage. There is no prototype of online Idein Bank. If selected we would like to exhibit the symbol of Idein (page 1), its description (page 2) and rules of use (page 3).
